We have some permutation A of [0, 1, ..., N - 1], where N is the length of A.
The number of (global) inversions is the number of i < j with 0 <= i < j < N and A[i] > A[j].
The number of local inversions is the number of i with 0 <= i < N and A[i] > A[i+1].
Return true if and only if the number of global inversions is equal to the number of local inversions.

Input Description:
First line contains, n the size of array.
Second line contains, n size of array as integrs.
